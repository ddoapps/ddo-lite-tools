' Define help topics with the following format:
'
' HelpTopic: <Topic Name>
'
' All text between "HelpTopic" identifiers is considered part of that help topic.
'
' Help text can include a small variety of special codes to handle formatting. These
' codes are limited to a single word. You can force multiple words to share a single
' code by separating the words with underscores (_) instead of spaces ( ). Underscores 
' in special codes are replaced by spaces when displayed.
' 
' Special codes are surrounded by curly braces "{}" and always begin the word they
' apply to. There are no closing tags, which is why they can only apply to a single
' word.
' 
' Basic formatting special codes are b for bold, i for italics and u for underline.
' You can use any one, two, or all three in a single code. Order doesn't matter. eg:
' {ub}This_text_is_bold_and_underlined
'
' You can also specify a link, of which there are several types:
'
' Open {url=https://www.google.com/}Google in default browser
' Open {run=\Settings.txt}Settings.txt in Notepad
' Run the {run=\GearPlanner.exe}Gear_Planner
' Open the {frm=frmOptions}Options form
' See {hlp=Spinners}Spinners for tips on using spinner controls.
'
' - Internally, opening a document {run=\Settings.txt} is handled the same way as
'   running a program {run=\GearPlanner.exe}
' - Add a backslash (\) character to the start of the file or program to run to 
'   specify the application folder. eg: {run=\Settings.txt}
' - URLs are opened in the default browser. 
' - Opening a form requires that you know the internal form name. Generally speaking,
'   form names are "frm" plus the form's title. eg: frmEnhancements. This is not always
'   the case, though. (Output Format is frmFormat, for example.)
'
' All codes and identifiers are case-sensitive. Special codes must be lower case.

HelpTopic: Screen Colors

You changed the screen colors when no screens were open. 

As a courtesy, the colors screen and this help screen have been opened for you to see what the colors look like.


HelpTopic: Output Format

Most forums strip out multiple spaces, so to force spacing there are two options: Either wrap the entire build in [code] tags, or replace spaces with dots and hide the dots by matching their color to the forum background.

There are several predefined formats included, but you can also create your own. Set up the BBCodes to match your forums then save your settings to a file. Any new format file created this way will appear in the format dropdown on the {frm=frmExport}Export screen.

The Text Colors checkbox allows you to turn off text colors while still using color codes to hide dots.

A typical color code will appear something like [color=#FFFFFF]. The "FFFFFF" part is the html color value. Use the dollar ($) sign as a placeholder for the html color value in your code.

Not all forums support lists, and those that do may not support numbered lists. You can set numbered list codes to the same as list codes, or disable lists altogether.

Using wrapper codes usually means you don't need to use dots.

{b}Reddit

Reddit output uses different logic than standard output; it's not a matter of just changing the code tags. This checkbox signals to the output routine to switch over to the hardcoded reddit logic.

Reddit output logic overrides all other settings on this screen, so they are disabled when reddit is checked.


HelpTopic: Overview

{b}Race

Iconic races normally require starting with at least one level of their associated classes:

Aasimar Scourge: Ranger
Bladeforged: Paladin
Deep Gnome: Wizard
Morninglord: Cleric
Purple Dragon Knight: Fighter
Shadar-kai: Rogue

You are free to choose any class you like starting at level 2, so long as it obeys alignment restrictions. The game then allows you to remove that initial class level by using an LR+1 heart.

If you select an iconic race on a new build, the builder automatically chooses its associated class. You can change it if you like, which assumes doing an LR to remove the required first level.

{b}Sub-Races

Racial variants like Wood Elf count as their parent race for racial reincarnation. If you choose a racial variant, a "Sub-Race" link will appear next to the race dropdown. Click it for verification of what the parent race is.

{b}Alignment

The Alignment field is optional. It's recommended to leave it blank unless there's a specific build reason for choosing one, such as True Neutral to allow Superior Stability.

Choosing an alignment filters your class choices, and making class choices filters the available alignments. If there ends up being only a single valid alignment, that one is chosen for you automatically.

{b}Max_Levels

Change this if your build has a self-imposed level cap, like for example a heroic challenge farmer who stays level 16 forever.

See {hlp=Spinners}Spinners for tips on using spinner controls.

{b}Classes

You can switch the class interface between graphical icons and dropdown lists in {frm=frmOptions}Options.

After choosing classes for a multi-class build, use the grid on the right to set up your level split.

The smaller "level" columns let you add and remove splash levels. Clicking a cell in one of those three columns assigns that class to the level.

The full class name column lets you re-order your splash classes. Grab a class name and drag it to a new level. Dragging classes this way swaps the two levels.

{b}Notes

In Notes mode, pressing the Tab key inserts a tab character into your notes. In Overview mode use Ctrl+Tab to insert a tab.

Notes aren't displayed in output.


HelpTopic: Colors

There are 90 different customizable colors used by the program: 72 screen colors and 18 output colors. Output colors are saved separately from screen colors to simplify changing your working colors without messing up your forum output.

In order to keep things manageable, there are a variety of ways to customize these colors.

The {b}Saved tab offers two simple lists of all your saved screen and output colors. Click any list item to apply those colors.

The {b}Palette tab provides a simple interface to apply any of the Google Material Design {url=https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html}color_palettes. Choosing or adjusting Material Palettes updates all 72 screen colors, applying a "best guess" algorithm to try and make all the various colors work together. This makes a passable interface, but you'll probably want to fine tune your palette in the Customize tab. Any further changes on the Palette tab will overwrite your customized colors.


{b}Custom_Colors

Click any color box to edit a color. You can edit colors with html codes, RGB values, choose a Material color, or even select a Windows system color.

Text and Background colors are not paired with each other, but instead can be matched in any combination. You could see Error Text on Normal background, Dim Text on Highlight Background, etc... 

For all possible combinations, all four text colors should be clearly legible when paired with all four background colors. Click the background color links to preview them.

Literal colors apply to text for output, but everywhere else they are only used for drawing icons. That means literal color text only needs to be legible for output.


{b}Output_Background

Match the color scheme of the forums where you post your builds. 

There are three distinct background colors to consider for the Official DDO Forums:
RGB: 51, 51, 51 -- Default post background.
RGB: 102,102,102 -- Default code tags background.
RGB: 17, 17, 17 -- {url=https://www.ddo.com/forums/showthread.php/415713-Forums-Stylebot-Changes}JJ's_Stylish background for both posts and code tags.

{b}Default background color (RGB:34,34,34) is the average of JJ's Stylish (RGB:17,17,17) and the official DDO forums (RGB:51,51,51).

{b}Code_Tags background color is only for previewing literal colors for text. Dots aren't needed inside code tags, but colored text is so be sure that the text for all literal colors is clearly legible with the code tags background color.

For forums that alternate colors every other post, it's recommended to use the average of the two colors by averaging the individual red, green and blue (RGB) values of both colors. The easiest way to identify RGB values is to use a freeware utility like {url=http://colorcop.net/download/}ColorCop.


{b}Files

Importing and exporting is set up to allow easy copy & pasting to and from forums. You can manually trim out codes you don't want included.

When you Import/Export/Save/Load colors, either screen or output colors are included depending on which area you have selected. 


{b}Literal_Colors

Literal colors are the seven augment colors found on gear. In the character builder, these seven colors are used in output to differentiate classes, stats and enhancement trees.

Orange is the color of Strength, Barbarian and Fighter
Red is the color of Dexterity, Rogue and Sorcerer
Green is the color of Constitution, Ranger and Druid
Blue is the color of Intelligence, Wizard and Artificer
Yellow is the color of Wisdom, Monk, Cleric and Favored Soul
Purple is the color of Charisma, Paladin, Bard and Warlock

Enhancement tree colors are only used if you set up a Leveling Guide. For most classes, all of their trees will default to one of the following four colors:

Red: Melee (basic), Evil, Fire 
Blue: Magic, Defense, Water
Green: Melee (flavor), Nature, Earth
Yellow: Health, Electricity
Grey: All racial trees

Using Bards as an example, Warchanter is red, Swashbuckler is green, Spellsinger is blue. For multiclass builds, the trees with more points spent get their preferred colors, with lower priority trees settling for complementary colors. Purple and Orange are generally only used as a last resort.


HelpTopic: Options

{b}GENERAL

{b}Recent_Files_Menu
Set the size of the list, or disable by choosing 0. Changes take effect immediately. Clear the list by scrolling to 0 then back up to the desired number. See 
=Spinners}Spinners for tips on using spinner controls.

{b}Show_Error_Log_on_startup
Any data errors are logged in a file named {run=\Error.log}Error.log in the same folder as the exe. This log file is always created if any errors are found. Check this option True to have the builder open the log file in notepad on startup.

{b}Child_Windows
By default, all dialogs will be opened as child forms of the main form. Child forms can be moved outside of the main form, but if the main form is minimized, all child forms will also be minimized. Uncheck this option if you want dialogs to be independent of the main form. Note: Unchecking this option will make forms "disappear" behind the main form whenever you go to the main form's menu system.

{b}Confirmation_Prompts
The program will ask for confirmation in a number of places. Any time you choose to delete multiple items at once, and also when closing the BBCodes form if you haven't applied your changes yet. Uncheck this box to skip many (but not all) confirmation popups.


{b}APPEARANCE

Turn off class icons to switch the Overview and Skills screens back to how they were in Version 1.x. You can selectively turn off icons for the Overview and Skills screens separately.

Indenting output can help make it more readable so that it's not flush against the left border of the screen.


{b}BUILD

{b}Default_Build_Points
Choose the default value when creating new builds.

{b}Skill_Order
Applies to the skills screen only, not output. Native skills first is most useful for pure class builds. For multi-class builds, the primary class's native skills are listed first, followed by native skills for all splash classes together in a single group, then cross-class skills last.

{b}Feat_Order
Applies to the feats screen only, not output. Grouping related feats will be alphabetized based on the first feat in the group. For example, THF / ITHF / GTHF will be listed under "T", even if you've already selected THF. Grouped feats are indented in the feats list.


{b}OUTPUT

{b}Skill_Order
Ranks Spent order additionally groups related skills. For example, trapping skills are grouped together provided they have the same total ranks.

{b}Feat_Order
Grouping feats by channel improves readability of the output. The general channel includes any feat slot that can hold a regular feat: heroic, epic, human bonus, fighter bonus, etc... Special feats that can never be taken in a regular slot, like Half-Elf Dilettante or Ranger Favored Enemy, get their own channels. Legendary feats are the exception, included with general feats.

{b}BBCodes
Customize all BBCodes used for output to match your forums.


HelpTopic: Stats

{b}Templates

See {hlp=Templates}Templates for help on Templates.


{b}Preferred_Build_Points 

Choose which distribution is used for skill points and feat prereqs. Changes made to your preferred distribution automatically propagate to the other distributions where possible.


{b}Output

Only valid distributions are displayed in output. You can also use the checkboxes to hide distributions that don't apply to your build.


{b}Spinners

For stat point spinners, typing and mouse wheel scrolling is disabled, but you can increment using large steps (5 at a time) or jump directly to min/max values. Because any given spinner's effective min/max values are dependent on other spinners, jumping the value progressively adds or subtracts points one at a time.

See {hlp=Spinners}Spinners for tips on using spinner controls.


{b}Tomes

Stat Tomes can go up to +8, and are applied as if used at level 1. Specifically:

You gain +2 at level 1
You gain +3 at level 3
You gain +4 at level 7
You gain +5 at level 11
You gain +6 at level 15
You gain +7 at level 19
You gain +8 at level 22

{b}NOTE: Tomes don't apply during character creation, but Fred sees them as applying at level 1. Meaning you can create a character with 11 strength, take a dummy feat at level 1, log into the world and buy and use a +2 strength tome, then exchange the level 1 dummy feat for Power Attack with Fred.

{b}Supreme is a courtesy feature to let you increase all tomes at the same time. It acts as a minimum value for individual tomes. Lowering the supreme value won't lower the individual tomes, only their minimum values. Use the middle mouse button to quickly clear individual tomes.


HelpTopic: Templates

Templates let you auto-apply stats and levelups for a basic build type based on your build's primary class. These are just guidelines, to be tweaked as appropriate for any given build.

Many templates by themselves won't qualify for necessary feats. For example, most TWF templates won't have enough dexterity for the TWF feats without tomes or levelups, especially for the 28pt version. Applying a template will notify you of obvious shortcomings like this.

If your primary class doesn't have trapping capability and your build has any rogue or artificer levels, you get Trapping versions of the templates. These are the same as the basic templates but with extra int for trapping.

Click the Templates header link to switch to templates of other classes.

Click the Customize header link to manage your custom templates.


{b}Custom_Templates

Edit Custom Templates copies Templates.txt from the Data\Builder folder to your Save folder if it doesn't already exist, then opens it in Notepad for editing.

On startup, if custom templates exist in your Save folder, those are read instead of the system templates in Data\Builder.

You can also edit system templates directly, but any changes to system templates will be overwritten by subsequent updates.

{b}Reload

After editing templates in Notepad, choose Reload Templates to reload and process your new templates. You will be notified of any errors in your templates file.


Custom templates are saved in your Save folder, which changes when you open a build from a different path. That could mean that your custom templates won't be found the next time you run the planner. With that in mind:

{u}Standard_Installation

If you have one copy of the programs and just use the default Save path under it, editing custom templates works normally.

{u}Multiple_Programs

If you run multiple versions of the programs, for example from different computers, and they all point to a shared save path, for example a Dropbox location, editing custom templates works normally.

{u}Multiple_Save_Locations

If you have multiple save locations, for example if you save builds to different folders depending on class, custom templates won't work properly. Each individual save path would have its own custom templates. In that case, you're probably better off customizing the system templates directly.

If you edit system templates, your changes will be overwritten each time the programs are updated. Prior to an update, make a copy of Data\Builder\Templates.txt and then restore it after the update.

Unfortunately, you won't know if any of the system templates have been changed by the update.

{u}Multiple_Everything

If you run multiple copies of the programs AND you have multiple save locations, there is no easy solution for maintaining a unified set of custom templates.


{b}Updates

If you maintain custom templates, and an update includes new or changed system templates, you'll get a message on startup detailing what templates have been changed. You can then manually copy those changed templates into your custom templates as desired.


HelpTopic: Spinners

{b}Spinners

Type a value into the spinner control, or navigate values with the keyboard or mouse.

{b}Typing

For spinners whose maximum value is greater than 9, type the full number you want. After a pause of a little under a second, the spinner assumes you're starting over. For example, when entering a three-digit number, if you type 2, 3, (pause), 4, the spinner will show 2, 23, then 4. 

Typing mode doesn't engage until the first non-zero digit.

Typing a number that's higher than the maximum value will default to the maximum, lower than the minimum results in the minimum. For example, typing the number 44 in a spinner whose max value is 30 results in 30.

{b}Hotkeys

The following keyboard hotkeys are recognized:

Small step higher: +, RightArrow
Large step higher: Up, PageUp
Maximum value: Home, Insert

Small step lower: -, LeftArrow
Large step lower: Down, PageDown
Minimum value: End, Delete

Toggle mouse step: Spacebar

{b}Mouse

Use the mouse wheel to scroll values. Toggle the step size by clicking the Middle button (click the mouse wheel) in the center of the spinner on the number itself.

Hold down a mouse button on the left and right arrows to quickly scroll values, or click to change the value one step at a time.

For the left and right arrows, all three mouse buttons have different effects:

Left Button: Small change
Right Button: Large change
Click Mousewheel: Set to minimum or maximum


HelpTopic: Export

You can export your builds to forums using a variety of BBCodes. 

The {frm=frmFormat}Format: text immediately left of the dropdown is a clickable link that opens the BBCodes screen for customizing output to match your forums. Or choose one of the pre-defined formats from the dropdown. Any formats you save to a file will appear in the dropdown.

The Plain Text format is useful for printing with {run=Notepad.exe}Notepad. Landscape printing may be preferable to Portrait depending on how wide your enhancement and destiny sections are.


HelpTopic: Skills

Native skills are shown with a lighter background than cross-class skills. Adjust the contrast level by clicking Contrast in the form header.

{b}Mouse

Hold down a mouse button to rapidly change values.

For a standard mouse, clicking the scroll wheel acts as the middle mouse button.

{b}SKILL_RANKS

{b}Cells

Left Click: Add ranks
Right Click: Remove ranks
Middle Click: Clear ranks

You can't add more ranks than you have skill points to spend on that level.

{b}Skill_Rows

Right Click a skill name to open a context menu, or Left Click to cycle through all four options:

Max Ranks (Half Ranks)
Applies all skill points possible each level. For cross class skills, apply half ranks.

Max Ranks (Full Ranks)
Applies all skill points possible each level, but never apply half ranks. For cross class skills, this results in a full rank every odd level.

Max Rank (Even Levels)
This is the complement pattern to Full Ranks, applying max possible full ranks (never half ranks) at even levels only.

Clear Ranks
Clear all ranks from all levels for the selected skill.

{b}Level_Columns

Clear all skill ranks from a level by right-clicking the level header.


{b}SKILL_TOMES

Skill Tomes can go up to +5, and are applied as if used at level 1. Specifically:

You gain +1 at level 1
You gain +2 at level 5
You gain +3 at level 9
You gain +4 at level 13
You gain +5 at level 17

Skill tomes have limited relevance in terms of build planning. Only a handful of feats have skill prereqs, and skill tomes only help qualify for some of them. Currently, skill tomes help qualify for the Single Weapon Fighting feat line and Epic Skill Focus destiny feats. They don't help qualify for Inspire Excellence.

Due to their limited relevance, skill tomes aren't included in output. Make note of any required skill tomes in your write-up for the build.

See {hlp=Spinners}Spinners for tips on using spinner controls.


HelpTopic: Feats

{b}Feat_Channels

Feats are separated into channels to simplify the slotting process. Each set of class-specific and race-specific feats have their own channel. Examples include Ranger Favored Enemies and Half-Elf Dilettante. Another channel handles deity feats.

The General channel includes heroic, epic, and destiny feats. Any feat slot that can hold a general feat is included in the general channel. Most bonus feats are in the general channel, including Fighter, Artificer, Wizard, Monk, and Human bonus feats. Legendary feats are also included in the general channel.

Switch channels using the links at the top of the window. If your build has no channels other than General, the only two options will be Selected and Granted.

{b}Finding_Feats

You can filter feats by purpose, by slot, or by a combination of both:

Use the filters list to filter feats by purpose: Melee, Spellcasting, etc... You can choose multiple options by holding down the Ctrl key when clicking. Choosing multiple filters this way shows feats that meet all selected filters. eg: Show all epic feats that are good for melee.

Click a feat slot to filter feats by slot. This is particularly useful for class bonus feats. When a slot filter is active, the feat list header will display the filter name. Click the slot again to remove the filter.

You can also change the order of the feats list from the {frm=frmOptions}Options screen. See the {hlp=Options}Help entry for Options for more information.

{b}Choosing_Feats

Once you find the feat you want, either drag it to the desired slot or double-click to auto-select it. Auto-selecting will apply the feat to either the first legal empty slot or the currently active slot filter.

If a feat has selectors, drag or double-click the desired selector instead of the feat.

{b}Changing_Feats

Re-order feats by dragging one slot to another. The feat dragged and the feat it's dropped onto will swap positions. 

The feat you drag can only be placed on a legal slot for that feat, but the feat you drop it onto will get swapped even if it's into an illegal slot. In that case, it will show as an error condition.

{b}Clearing_Feats

Double-click a slot to clear it.

Drag a feat back to the feats list to clear it.

Right-clicking will bring up a context menu that includes options to clear that slot, or all slots. Clearing all slots will ask for confirmation.

{b}Alternate_Feats

For some builds, there will be a "player's choice" where there isn't a clear recommendation to make. One example might be a Swashbuckler, where you likely would give a choice between Improved Critical: Piercing, Slashing or Bludgeoning.

Set up alternate feats by right-clicking the main slot and choosing Alternate Feat from the context menu. A new slot will appear immediately below the main slot.

Alternate feats are exempt from stat, skill, past life and feat prereqs. This lets you set up conditional builds that might say "take x, or y if you have a stat tome / past life / etc..." 

The builder considers alternate feats as not actually taken. They are ignored when checking feat prereqs for other feats in your build. Be mindful of game rules when defining alternate feats.

{b}Exchange_Feats

Some builds will start off with a feat to help with leveling, then switch it out for something better in higher levels. One example might be a mechanic taking heavy repeater proficiency at level 3, then swapping it out for something else at level 12 when they get proficiency from the ML12 core.

Set up feat swaps by right-clicking the slot that will be exchanged at a later level. You will be prompted to choose what level the exchange will happen, then a new feat slot will appear at that level. 

All prereqs are fully enforced for exchanged feats, both before and after the exchange. Fred's rules are also enforced, showing an error if you exchange a feat that Fred wouldn't allow.

{b}NOTE: Tomes don't apply during character creation, but Fred sees them as applying at level 1. Meaning you can create a character with 11 strength, take a dummy feat at level 1, log into the world and buy and use a +2 strength tome, then exchange the level 1 dummy feat for Power Attack with Fred.

{b}Granted_Feats

Click the Granted Feats tab to view all your granted feats, from both race and class. Click a granted feat to view details.


HelpTopic: Import Colors

Importing colors is designed to allow easy sharing of color values via forums. It also allows you to pick and choose which colors you want to import.

Fill the text area with color data by pasting from clipboard, or by loading from a file.

You can manually delete any color data from the text area you don't want to import. For example, after setting up a new color scheme, you could import the default output colors for consistency.

Once you have the desired color data, click {b}Apply_Colors to commit these colors.


HelpTopic: Export Colors

Exporting colors is designed to allow easy sharing of color values via forums. It also allows you to pick and choose which colors you want to export.

The text area starts off with all your current color data. You can manually delete any color data from the text area you don't want to export. 

Once you have the desired color data, you can copy it to clipboard for sharing on forums, or save it to a file.


HelpTopic: Spells

There are two different spell choices to make while leveling: Inscribing spells into your spell book during levelup, and actually slotting the spells you can cast while questing.

The builder is only concerned with which spells to slot for questing, ignoring the spells you choose at levelup.

For any given class and spell level, you will have a list of all slots and what character level (not class level) they become available.

Multiclass builds may have up to three different spell books, one for each class. Change the active spell book with the dropdown.

See {hlp=Spinners}Spinners for tips on using spinner controls.


{b}Choosing_Spells

Drag spells to the desired slot or double-click to auto-select. Auto-selecting will place the spell in the first legal empty slot.

Remove spells with double-click, or by dragging them back to the list.

Right-click a slot to bring up a context menu that lets you clear the current spell, all spells for the current class, or all spells for the entire build.


{b}Mandatory_Spells

Clerics receive cure spells for free, and these cure spells cannot be unlearned.

Warlocks receive Pact spells for free, which also cannot be unlearned. Pact spells are dependent on the Pact feat you choose in the {frm=frmFeats}Feats screen. Changing your pact feat will update your pact spells.


{b}Free_Spells

Artificers may select Repair and Inflict spells for free. These do no cost a spell slot. Note: Only the standard versions are free; the mass versions cost a slot.

Druids may select any Summon Nature's Ally spell for free. These also do not cost a spell slot.

Free spells can technically be taken at any level, but since they are free, any free spells you choose will be auto-slotted into the first level they become available.


{b}Rare_Scrolls

Even though the builder ignores spell inscription, you should be mindful of the rare scrolls list while leveling. As a general rule, choose any rare spells you can at levelup.

HelpTopic: Destiny

Your character can only have one active destiny, so your build plan can only include a single destiny. Changing your destiny will ask for confirmation before resetting all your destiny abilities.


{b}Twists_of_Fate

Twists of Fate allow you to use abilities from other destinies that you have unlocked. You can twist abilities up to tier 4, but not tier 5 or 6. For a detailed explanation of Twists of Fate, see {url=http://ddowiki.com/page/Twist_of_Fate}this_wiki_article.

If you have selected an active destiny, the Twists list won't include any abilities from that destiny.

You can have up to 5 twists of fate:

3 standard
1 epic levels
1 epic completionist

Each slot must be upgraded to the same tier as the ability you want put in it. For example, slotting a tier 3 ability requires upgrading a twist slot to tier 3.

Upgrading twist slots costs fate points, which are earned from epic levels, epic destinies, epic past lives, and tomes of fate. 

Epic levels grant a flat +5 fate points for free. You gain an additional +1 fate point for every 3 destiny levels (from any destiny) you achieve, up to a maximum of 5 levels per destiny. You also gain +1 fate point for every 4 Epic Past Lives you have.

There is currently a maximum of 37 fate points available in the game:

20 from epic destinies (12 destinies * 5 levels = 60 / 3 = 20)
9 from epic past lives (12 past lives * 3 max stack = 36 / 4 = 9)
5 from epic levels
3 from a +3 fate tome
--
37 fate points

Twist upgrades start at 1 fate point, costing one additional point for each tier and twist. All costs are cumulative. The net costs  break down to:

Slot 1 costs 1 / 3 / 6 / 10 fate points for tier 1/2/3/4
Slot 2 costs 2 / 5 / 9 / 13 fate points
Slot 3 costs 3 / 7 / 12 / 18 fate points
Slot 4 costs 4 / 9 / 15 / 22 fate points
Slot 5 costs 5 / 11 / 18 / 26 fate points

It's cheapest to keep your highest tier twists in the earliest slots. Re-order your selected twists by dragging.


HelpTopic: Enhancements

{b}Trees

Every build gets a racial tree, plus you may choose up to six additional trees.

Double-click or drag to select trees.

Remove trees with double-click.

Right-clicking a selected tree opens a context menu that lets you reset or delete trees.


Racial Past Life AP is earned by racial reincarnating for the same race three times. The first life grants a skill bonus, the second a stat, and the third grants +1 AP to use in any racial tree. You can earn +1 racial AP for every non-iconic race, excluding sub-races.

Racial past life AP can be spent at any time. You can spend it all at level 1, or wait and spend it later.


{b}Enhancements

Each character level grants 4 AP to spend on enhancements, up to a maximum of 80 AP at level 20.

You can only take Tier 5 enhancements from one tree. Selecting Tier 5s from a second tree will prompt you about cleaning out the other tree's Tier 5s.

Double-click or drag to select enhancements. 

Remove enhancements with double-click or by dragging them back to the list.

Enhancements can't be re-ordered; they lock into their natural position in the tree.

Right-click a selected enhancement to open a context menu that lets you remove an enhancement or reset the entire tree.

{b}Leveling_Guide

See the {hlp=Leveling_Guide}Leveling_Guide topic for more information.


HelpTopic: Leveling_Guide

The Leveling Guide allows you to plan out the exact order of enhancements taken at each level. This isn't typically needed; a simple list of all enhancements taken is generally sufficient for posting a build.

In its simplest form, the Leveling Guide only displays trees and enhancements you chose on the Enhancements tab. These are referred to as "selected." By default, you only see enhancements that are both selected and available. Use the dropdown to change the current filter.

There are also a small selection of special commands: Bank AP, and Reset Tree(s).

Add enhancements by double-clicking. If an enhancement has multiple ranks, you don't have to add each one individually. Adding a higher rank automatically adds all previous ranks. 

When working with the Leveling Guide, there is always a current level. This is displayed at the bottom of the list. There may be times when you think an enhancement should be available, but it may not be due to the current level. For example, an 18/2 wizard/rogue build that starts with rogue at level 1. No wizard enhancements will be available until the current level is at least 2.

Enhancements are always added to the end of this list, and if the minimum level for an enhancement you add is higher than the current level, the current level is raised to match.

To manually force the guide to step to the next level, choose Bank AP from the (Commands) group. This will save all remaining AP for this level to spend on the next level.

There are several ways to select multiple enhancements at once:
 - Hold the left button while dragging the mouse. You can drag the mouse above or below the screen to scroll the list.
 - Hold the Ctrl key while individually clicking rows on or off.
 - Select an anchor row, hold the Shift key and click a different row to select everything in between.

Right-click any selected row to open a context menu that lets you move or delete rows. To move row(s), first mark them to be moved, then right-click a new row and choose Insert. Moved rows are inserted before the row you choose. Moving multiple rows at once retains their relative order.

{b}Export

The Export link provides a simple way to print out the Leveling Guide for reference while playing.

When you Export the Leveling Guide you will be asked to save a CSV file, and then the file will immediately be opened for you with whatever program normally opens them. CSV stands for Comma Separated Values, and is a standard format readable by any spreadsheet program, like Excel. 


HelpTopic: Frequently Asked Questions

{b}What_happened_to_the_old_"More"_button_on_the_Export_screen?

It's still there, just hidden. The "Format:" text to the left of the dropdown list is a clickable link that opens the BBCodes screen.


{b}Where_is_Heavy_Armor_Proficiency?

The Light, Medium and Heavy Armor Proficiency feats have been consolidated into a single feat named Armor Proficiency. It has three selectors (Light, Medium, Heavy) which have the same prereqs as the feats do in game. It can be found quickly using the filter group Defense.


{b}Why_is_there_an_output_format_called_Something_Awful?

{b}Why_are_some_classes_missing_in_Overview?

When using text mode, the class dropdowns are filtered based on your chosen alignment. If you haven't chosen one yet, your alignment choices are still filtered based on class choices. Picking Bard, for example, will filter out Lawful Good and Lawful Neutral alignments, which in turn filters Paladin and Monk out of the class dropdowns.

This is less confusing if you use the icon interface, as the filtered classes are still shown, grayed out.


HelpTopic: Import

To import a build from the forums, copy & paste it into the import area then click Translate Build.

When copying builds to the clipboard, copy them while in the standard forum view. Don't copy from inside a reply box. (In other words, don't copy bbcodes; just the pure display text.)

For builds inside code tags, best results are from selecting only the contents inside the code tags. Selecting from above to below the code box works in many cases, but not all.

Only builds that are posted with the Character Builder Lite export format can be imported.


HelpTopic: Convert_Builds

Up through version 2.4, build files were saved in a binary format with a {b}bld extension. Starting with version 3.0, builds are saved as text files with a {b}build extension.

You can still open old binary files normally, but saving defaults to the new text format. The key advantage to the text format is the ability to fix bugged builds manually using notepad.

{b}Folder

Click the "..." button to choose a folder containing binary bld files. It's the standard OpenFile dialog; choose any bld file to select the folder it's in. (The OpenFolder dialog is a terrible interface.)

You can manually type or paste a path into the folder field. To then choose that folder, press Enter.

{b}Storage

Your old binary bld files aren't deleted after conversion. Instead, they are moved into the {b}\Save\Binary folder. 

You can leave those old files there for safekeeping, or delete them at your convenience.

{b}Messages

Any errors converting a build are displayed in the messages window. If there are no errors, the message window will be blank. Any builds that can't be converted for whatever reason will still be moved to the {b}\Save\Binary folder.

{b}Specs

Specs for the new text file structure can be found in the {hlp=Save_File_Specifications}Save_File_Specifications help topic, which has been added to the Help menu.


HelpTopic: Convert

Starting with version 3.0, builds are saved as text files instead of binary files. It is strongly recommended that you convert all your old binary files to the new text format.

Your binary files won't be deleted by the conversion, but instead moved to a new {b}\Save\Binary folder for safekeeping. You can delete them (and that folder) as desired.

You can still open binary files normally, but binary files won't be added to the MRU list in the File menu.

Specs for the new text file structure can be found in the {hlp=Save_File_Specifications}Save_File_Specifications help topic, which has been added to the Help menu.

Builds are saved in text files with {b}build as the extension. For example: 
Kensei Warpriest.build

Build files use a structure similar to ini files. Section headers are surrounded by [brackets], and data lines use the following format:

Field: Value

Fields are not case sensitive, but values are.

Field names can be duplicates, either adding to a single value (as with Notes) or specifying elements in a list.

There must be a space following the colon (:) character, and that space is not part of the Value. Values may be single values, or a tab-delimited array of values. Values can contain colons; only the first colon is used to signify field names.

All sections and fields are optional, but section order is required to be the same as the screens in the program. You can't assign skills to a character who has no classes defined, etc...

In some instances, field order is required.

A line that begins with a semicolon (;) is considered a comment and ignored.

[Overview]

The overview section has the following fields:

{b}Name
Your build name

{b}Race
Race name

{b}Alignment
Alignment name

{b}MaxLevels
Max Levels as defined in the Overview screen

{b}Notes
Each Notes line is a single line. Notes with a blank line will include a blank Notes field. For example:

Notes: This is the 1st line.
Notes: This is the 2nd line, which is very long but since it is a single paragraph there is no newline character. The entire paragraph is considered one Notes line.
Notes: 
Notes: This is the 4th line. When viewing these notes in the program, there is a blank line between lines 2 and 4.

{b}Class
Class name. There can be up to three different Class fields. Each corresponds to the classes chosen on the Overview screen, in the same order as they are chosen in the build. Any additional Class fields beyond three are ignored. For example:

Class: Fighter
Class: Monk

The first class field encountered is applied to all 20 heroic levels. These can be changed in the following section.

Class fields must appear before Level fields.

{b}Level
Not included for pure builds. For multiclass builds, there will be exactly 20 level fields, one for each possible heroic level. Even if MaxLevels is less than 20, there must still be 20 Level fields for all multiclass builds.

Each level value contains two elements separated by a tab character: Level Number (numeric) and Class Name (text). For example:

Level: 1   {i}(tab)   Fighter
Level: 2   {i}(tab)   Fighter
Level: 3   {i}(tab)   Monk
etc...

[Stats]

The stats section has a couple fields, plus a table:

{b}Preferred
Name of the preferred build points, which can be one of the following values:
  Adventurer
  Champion
  Hero
  Legend

Names are used instead of point values because Drow don't have the same points to spend as the other races.

{b}(Include_Build_Points)
Up to four different fields signifying their "Include?" checkboxes. Assumed to be Yes, these fields only appear if they {i}aren't included, where the values will be "No". For example, a first life build might show:
Hero: No
Legend: No

{b}Stats_Table
A table of six fields, each named as the first three letters of the stat name in all caps:
STR: (value)
DEX: (value)
etc...

Tables don't use tabs, only spaces. Zeros are saved as spaces for readability. Stat values are stored as points spent, not the ending stat value, meaning the valid range is 1 to 6, 8, 10, 13 and 16. No other stat values are allowed. Tomes can be in a range of 1 to 8.

The character positions for each stat line are as follows:

1-4: Adventurer
7-10: Champion
13-16: Hero
19-22: Legend
25-28: Tome

Remember that the first space after the colon is not counted as part of the value line.

{b}Levelup
Two values delimited by a tab character. The first value is a numeric level with a valid range of 0,4,8,12,16,20,24,28. The second is the stat name for that levelup. For example:

Levelup: 4   {i}(tab)   Strength

Levelup 0 is the "All Levels" value in the Stats screen.

[Skills]

The entire skills section is one single table, with no other fields. Each field name is an abbreviated skill name, up to a maximum of 7 characters, padded with spaces so the rows align.

Tables don't use tabs, only spaces. Zeros are saved as spaces for readability. Skill values are stored as points spent, not ranks received, meaning that all values will be integers. (No half ranks.) Tomes have a valid range of 1 to 5.

The character positions for each level column are as follows:

1-3: Level 1
5-7: Level 2
etc...
82-84: Skill Tome

All values are three characters wide, typically a single digit surrounded by spaces. The formula for where it starts based on level:

(Level - 1) * 4 + 1

Note that the Skill Tome column (effectively level 21) does not follow this formula; it starts at character 82 instead of 81 for readability.

The skill abbreviations are:

Concent
Diplo
Disable
Haggle
Heal

[Feats]

Build feats are stored internally in separate channels, one array for each channel. Most channels will have multiple feat lines in the build file.

Unless otherwise specified, each feat line's field is the channel name, and each value is a two-element array separated by a tab:

Channel: Slot Identifier   {i}(tab)   Feat Name: Selector Name

The slot identifier is a text name followed by a space then a number specifying the character level it's taken. Even when it seems redundant, like for Legend and Race feats, the identifier is a required ID field used by Alternate and Exchange feats.

{b}Granted
Granted feats aren't stored in the build file, but instead are calculated after the [Overview] section is read.

{b}Standard
Standard feats are heroic, epic and destiny feats, but not legend feats. Valid identifier names are "Heroic", "Epic" and "Destiny". Level is character level.

{b}Legend
Only a single feat entry is allowed. Identifier is always "Legend 30".

{b}Race
The identifer is race name and character level.

{b}Class1
{b}Class2
{b}Class3
All class feats for all three channels use the generic "Class" as their field name. The identifier is a class name followed by class level, not character level. On load, the program internally searches the build classes to figure out which Class# channel this feat belongs to. For example, a monk might show:

Class: Monk 1   {i}(tab)   Two Weapon Fighting
Class: Monk 2   {i}(tab)   Stunning Fist
Class: Monk 3   {i}(tab)   Path of Harmonious Balance
Class: Monk 6   {i}(tab)   Dodge

{b}Deity
Deity feat allocation is unusually complex, and handled internally. The saved identifier only needs the name "Deity" and the character level that feat is taken.

{b}Alternate
Alternate feat identifiers point to the parent slot. For example, an alternate human bonus feat offering Precision as an option would be listed as:

Alternate: Human 1   {i}(tab)   Precision

{b}Exchange
Exchange feats are an exception to the above parsing rule in that there are three columns instead of two. The first column is the identifier, which works the same as for Alternate feats. The second column is the character level when the exchange happens, and the third column is the feat. 

For example, imagine a stick build using falchions until 23 when it switches to sireth. Changing out Improved Critical: Slashing feat -- which would typically be taken at level 9 -- might appear as:

Exchange: Heroic 9   {i}(tab)   23   {i}(tab)   Improved Critical: Bludgeoning

The enhancements section starts with two optional fields:

{b}Tier5 
Tree Name for the Tier 5 tree. Not included if there is no Tier 5 tree.

{b}RacialAP
Number of Racial APs this build has. Not included if zero.

The rest of the enhancements section defines the trees and the enhancements taken from each:

{b}Tree
The tree name.

{b}Type
What type of tree this is. Valid choices are:
  Class
  Race
  Global
  RaceClass
Global is for trees like Harper Agent, and RaceClass is for trees like Elf Arcane Archer.

{b}Source
Name of the class that provides this tree. Not included for non-class trees. Source determines how many class levels the tree has. Enhancement trees always point to the class with more levels. For example, an 18/2 Fighter/Paladin using the Vanguard tree will list Fighter as the source instead of Paladin.

{b}ClassLevels
Number of class levels this tree has. Race, Global and RaceClass trees will list the build's MaxLevels.

{b}Ability
List of abilities taken from this tree in the following format:

Ability: Tier #: Ability Name: Selector Name (Rank #)

Both Selector Name and Rank are optional. Abilities without ranks are assigned Rank 1.

Use Tier 0 for core abilities.

Some abilities have a colon in their name, like Warpriest Tier 3: Inflame: Energy Absorption. The builder will parse that into an ability and selector, but will still be able to find it correctly.

[LevelingGuide]

The leveling guide is a simple list of abilities in the order they are taken:

Guide: TreeID Tier #: Ability Name: Selector Name (Rank #)

Selector Name and Rank are both optional. Ranks defaults to Rank 1 if not specified.

TreeID is the Abbreviation for the tree, which can be found in the {run=\Data\Builder\Enhancements.txt}Enhancements.txt data file. (Search for "Abbreviaton: ") Any tree without an abbreviation line uses its full name instead.

Some trees can be chosen from multiple classes in the same build. For example, an 18/2 Paladin/Fighter can choose the Vanguard tree from either Paladin or Fighter. In this situation, a three-letter abbreviation from the source class is included at the end of the TreeID. For example:

Guide: Vanguard (Pal) Tier 0: To the Fore!

Class suffixes are defined in {run=\Data\Builder\Classes.txt}Classes.txt as the fourth (final) entry in the "Initial: " field. 

Don't include a class suffix unless the build can actually choose the tree from two different classes.

Note: Some trees already have a class suffix as part of their abbreviation, like the two Eldritch Knight trees. Those always need to be included since they are part of the actual TreeID.

There are also a few special codes:

Guide: Bank AP
Guide: Reset All Trees
Guide: Reset Tree: TreeID

{b}Ability

[Twists]

The twist section has one ability line per twist, listed in the order they are taken.

Twist: Tree Name Tier #: Ability Name: Selector Name

Tree Name is the full tree name, not the abbreviation like the Leveling Guide uses.

Selector Name is optional.

There is no rank data for twists.


HelpTopic: Messages

The messages screen details game rule changes that impact a build since the last time it was saved.

Messages will display on build load if any exist, and will also appear in the Tools menu.

Some messages are just informational, like known name changes. Others are errors that should be resolved where possible. Double-click each issue to resolve it.

When enhancement trees get a complete pass, your best bet is to simply clear it in your enhancements, reset the leveling guide, and start over.

If you close the messages screen before resolving all issues, you can resume from where you left off by going to Tools => Messages.


HelpTopic: Stat Template Change

Your custom Templates.txt is not being used because the system Templates.txt file has been updated.

The most recent template changes were to:

Druid => Caster

Druid => Wolf

Druid => Bear

You can copy those changes into your custom Templates.txt as desired. If not, open your custom Templates.txt and save it so that it reflects a more recent file date than the system version.

NOTE: Changes to a template usually include changes to the trapping version of the same template.
